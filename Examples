There are several different ways that you can analyze your licenses, but I have listed a variety of examples that helps you get an idea of the possibilities.

This is an example of licensing your hosts by physical cores with software assurance and custom pricing. 

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'Host'
,@LicenseMethod = 'Core'
,@SQLEdition = 'Enterprise'
,@SQLVersion = '2017'
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'Y'
,@CoreNumber = 16
,@CoreLicenseCost = 14000
,@CoreSACost = 3000

This is an example of licensing your individual virtual machines by cores. This is for a cluster build and includes software assurance, custom costs, and a review of memory allocation.

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'VM'
,@LicenseMethod = 'Core'
,@SQLEdition = 'Standard'
,@SQLVersion = '2016'
,@HighAvailability = 'Cluster'
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'Y'
,@MaxMemoryMB = 56000
,@CoreNumber = 8
,@CoreLicenseCost = 3900
,@CoreSACost = 800

This is an example of licensing a physical server by physical cores. This is for an AG build and does not include software assurance and custom costs (estimated costs are used).

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'Physical'
,@LicenseMethod = 'Core'
,@SQLEdition = 'Enterprise'
,@SQLVersion = '2014'
,@HighAvailability = ‘AG’
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'N'
,@CoreNumber = 16

This is an example of licensing a physical or virtual server by device or user CALs. This is for a standalone server, includes software assurance, reviews core and memory allocations and uses custom costs.

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'VM'
,@LicenseMethod = 'CAL'
,@SQLEdition = 'Standard'
,@SQLVersion = '2012'
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'Y'
,@MaxMemoryMB = 24000
,@CoreNumber = 8
,@CALnumber = 100
,@CALServerLicenseCost = 1000
,@CALCost = 400
,@CALSACost = 125

This is an example of licensing containers by cores with no software assurance, but with custom license cost

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'Container'
,@LicenseMethod = 'Core'
,@SQLEdition = 'Standard'
,@SQLVersion = '2017'
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'N'
,@MaxMemoryMB = 56000
,@CoreNumber = 8
,@CoreLicenseCost = 3900

This is an example of licensing physical hosts with Standard edition (which is not typically allowed), but using the Override parameter to still allow you to still get the cost

Exec dbo.sp_licensingcalculator
@ServerType = 'Host'
,@LicenseMethod = 'Core'
,@SQLEdition = 'Standard'
,@SQLVersion = '2017'
,@SoftwareAssurance = 'Y'
,@CoreNumber = 16
,@Override = 1
